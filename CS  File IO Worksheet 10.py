#The range tells us how spread out a group of numbers are. To calculate the range we subtract the
#smallest number from the largest.


#The frequency is a count of how often each different number appears


#The mean is the average of all the numbers. To calculate the mean, add all the numbers together
#and divide this value by the number of numbers


#The mode is the number which appears most often. If two numbers occur with the same frequency,
#the data is bi-modal, and more than two is multimodal
