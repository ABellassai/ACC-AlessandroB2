# 1. Write a function that returns the largest element in a list
import random

for a in range (0,5):
    n = random.randint(1,50)
    list1.append(n)
print(list1)

# 2. Write function that reverses a list in place – this means you don’t create a new list


# 3. Write a function that checks whether an element occurs in a list


# 4. Write a function that returns the elements in odd positions in a list


# 5. Write a function that computes the running total of a list


# 6. Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome


# 7. Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a list: using a
# for-loop, a while-loop and recursion


# 8. Write a function perfect_square that to print the first n perfect squares. The
# perfect squares can be found by multiplying each natural number with itself.
# The first few perfect squares are 1*1= 1, 2*2=4, 3*3=9, 4*4=16.
# n is input by the user



# 9. Write a function that concatenates two lists. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] → [a,b,c,1,2,3]



# 10.Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements, e.g.
# [a,b,c], [1,2,3] → [a,1,b,2,c,3].



# 11.Write a function that merges two sorted lists into a new sorted list.
# [1,3,6],[2,4,5] → [1,2,3,4,5,6].
