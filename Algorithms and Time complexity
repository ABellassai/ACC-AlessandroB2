Algorithms and Time complexity
•	Measured by the number of operations required for an input of size n
•	The fewer the number of operations the faster the algorithm
•	If the algorithm is independent of the size of the input it is called a Constant time Algorithm
Constant time complexity graph




time




Size of input (n)

•	All math operators are constant time (It is a fixed variable and not unknown)



•	An algorithm has Linear Time if a number of operations is directly proportional to the size of the input n.





time

Quadratic complexity


time



				size of input
If the number of the operator is proportional to the square of the input of size n. The relationship is said to be a quadratic.
