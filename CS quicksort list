# STEP 1. Choose the most right element in the list as the pivot
# STEP 2. Create three empty lists called left_list, middle_list and right_list
# STEP 3. for each element (key) in the list
# if element is < pivot add it to left_list
# if element is == pivot add it to middle_list
# if element is > pivot add it to right_list
# STEP 4. The result is a list made up by applying steps 1-3 to left_list, followed by the elements in
# the middle_list, followed by applying steps 1-3 to right_list
